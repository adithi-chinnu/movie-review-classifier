# movie-review-classifier

## Overview

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews from IMDb (Internet Movie Database). Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text, in this case, movie reviews. The goal is to classify reviews into positive and negative sentiments.

## IMDb Dataset

The IMDb dataset used in this project can be downloaded from the following link:

[IMDb Dataset](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/)

Please note that IMDb may have specific terms of use for their data. Make sure to review and comply with their terms and conditions when using their dataset.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, you should have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries (e.g., NLTK or spaCy)
- Machine learning or deep learning framework (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch)
- NumPy (for numerical operations)
- Any additional libraries as specified in the code.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/imdb-sentiment-analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd imdb-sentiment-analysis
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install nltk numpy scikit-learn
   ```

4. Data Preparation

   Download the IMDb dataset from the provided link and preprocess it to create a training dataset for your sentiment analysis model. You may need to clean, tokenize, and split the data into positive and negative sentiment classes.

5. Model Building

   You can build a sentiment analysis model using machine learning or deep learning techniques. Make sure to properly preprocess the text data, extract features, and train your model. Example code snippets can be added to your Python script to guide you.

6. Evaluate and Predict

   Evaluate your model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Once your model is trained, you can use it to predict sentiments for new movie reviews.
